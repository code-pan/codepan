We have worked with [UPcload](http://www.upcload.com),
Nokia, [Fraunhofer Institute FAME](http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/fame/index.html)
and many more.

### UPcload / FitAnalytics

Developed for UPcload a parser that pre-processes the content
of thousands of PDF and Excel files into a normalized database. 

This parser saved hundreds of man hours that would have been spent
manually collecting this data.

A Node.js backend with supporting Bash scripts was developed
to perform this process.
A Javascript/JQuery frontend was developed to access the data.
